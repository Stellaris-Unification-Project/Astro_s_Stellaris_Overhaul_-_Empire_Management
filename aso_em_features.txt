[h1]Astro's Stellaris Overhaul - Empire Management[/h1]
This mod is meant to provide you (and the AI!) with more options for running your empire. It includes only internal-facing changes, and doesn't change diplomacy or relations with other empires.
Note: Should be compatible with virtually any mod.
